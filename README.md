# Time Lens for Blender

This simple addon is a quick and easy way to automatically capture your entire current Blender editor window as you work. It will screenshot your Blender window silently in the background and place those screenshots in your desired directory.

## Features
(To be written)

### File name scheme
The naming scheme for the PNG screenshots is very simple:

`{name-of-blend-file} YYYY-MM-DD at HH.MM.SS ({width x height}).png`

A real file example would look something like this:

`Default Cube 2025-06-18 at 18.19.51 (1256x708).png`

It's possible to remove the image dimensions from the filename inside of the addon's preferences.

## How to install
Download the `TimeLens.zip` from the Releases on this repository and install it in Blender like any other add-on.
